EcodeCamp Internships Tasks:
Task1:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Customer Churn
Objective: Conduct an exploratory data analysis on a customer churn dataset to identify patterns
and insights.
Task Roadmap:
 Data Collection:
o Use a customer churn dataset from Kaggle or similar sources.
o Review features and target variables.
 Data Preprocessing:
o Handle missing values and outliers.
o Normalize or standardize data if necessary.
 Exploratory Analysis:
o Perform statistical analysis to understand data distributions.
o Visualize data using histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
o Identify patterns and potential predictors of churn.
Task2:
Stock Price Prediction System
Objective: Develop a real-time stock price prediction system using historical stock data.
Task Roadmap:
 Data Collection:
o Use financial APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance) to collect stock data.
o Pre-process the data (feature engineering, scaling).
 Model Building:
o Train a time-series forecasting model using LSTM or ARIMA.
o Evaluate model performance.
Task3:
EDA ON Titanic Survival Predictions
Objective: Develop a predictive model to determine the survival likelihood of passengers on the
Titanic.
Task Roadmap:
 Data Collection:
o Use the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
o Understand the features and target variable.
 Data Preprocessing:
o Handle missing values.
o Perform feature engineering (e.g., creating new features like family size).
o Encode categorical variables.
 Model Building:
o Split the data into training and testing sets.
o Train multiple models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest,
etc.).
o Evaluate and select the best-performing model.
